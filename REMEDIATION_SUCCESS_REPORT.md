- **1 E0599 error** (method not found)
- **Multiple import and syntax issues**

### After Remediation
- **‚úÖ 0 compilation errors**
- **‚úÖ All error categories resolved**
- **‚úÖ Codebase compiles successfully**
- **‚úÖ Ready for development and testing**

  - Standardized naming across all components
- **Result**: 100% of E0425 errors resolved

### Phase 3: Struct Definition Alignment ‚úÖ
- **Target**: 6+ E0560/E0609 struct field errors
- **Actions**:
  - Aligned struct definitions with usage patterns
  - Fixed field access issues
  - Updated validation structs
- **Result**: 100% of E0560/E0609 errors resolved

### Phase 4: Final Cleanup ‚úÖ
- **Target**: 1 E0599 method not found error
- **Actions**:
  - Fixed method implementation issues
  - Added missing imports
  - Resolved final compilation blockers
- **Result**: 100% of E0599 errors resolved
