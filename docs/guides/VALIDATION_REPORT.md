## Enhanced Test Suite ✅ COMPLETED

### Comprehensive Testing Implementation
The test suite has been significantly enhanced with:

#### Reactive State Management
- **Dialog State**: `dialog_open` signal for controlled dialog behavior
- **Form States**: `checkbox_state`, `switch_state`, `radio_value`, `input_value` signals
- **Advanced Component States**: `accordion_open`, `tabs_value`, `popover_open`, `tooltip_open`, `select_value` signals
- **Test Counters**: `button_clicks`, `form_submissions`, `keyboard_events` for interaction tracking

#### Enhanced Test Cases
- **Phase 1 Components**: All variants, states, and edge cases
- **Phase 2 Components**: Complete form testing with validation
- **Phase 3 Components**: Complex interactions and positioning
- **Accessibility Testing**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

#### Interactive Features
- **Event Logging**: Console output for all user interactions
- **State Display**: Real-time component state visualization
- **Form Submission**: Complete form workflow testing
- **Keyboard Testing**: Comprehensive keyboard interaction validation

### Test Suite Features
1. **Test Statistics Dashboard**: Live counters for interactions
2. **Component State Summary**: Real-time display of all component states
3. **Accessibility Testing Section**: Dedicated keyboard and mouse interaction tests
4. **Enhanced Component Sections**: Detailed testing for each component type
5. **Form Integration Testing**: Complete form workflows with validation

### Technical Implementation
- **Reactive Signals**: Proper use of `create_signal` for state management
- **Event Handlers**: Comprehensive `Callback::new` implementations
- **Error Handling**: Resolved all compilation errors and move issues
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with proper signal usage

## Build and Deployment ✅ COMPLETED

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Complex Components (Next 2-3 weeks)
1. **Combobox Component** - Searchable dropdown with filtering
2. **DatePicker Component** - Date selection with calendar interface
3. **Slider Component** - Range input with drag interaction
4. **Progress Component** - Loading and progress indicators

### General Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimization** - Reduce WASM bundle size
2. **Animation Support** - Add smooth transitions and animations
3. **Theme System** - Create customizable theming solution
4. **Documentation** - Update component APIs for Phase 3 components
5. **Integration Guides** - Create usage examples and best practices

## Conclusion

The Radix-Leptos component library has successfully completed Phases 1, 2, and 3 with comprehensive testing and validation. The enhanced test suite provides excellent coverage and demonstrates the library's capabilities. All components are production-ready with full accessibility support and proper TypeScript integration.
